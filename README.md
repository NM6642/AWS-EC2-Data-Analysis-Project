# EC2 Data Analysis Project

This project aims to perform data analysis on COVID-19 data using an EC2 instance. It involves connecting to the EC2 instance, transferring the dataset, and performing analysis using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.

## Setup

1. **EC2 Instance Setup**: Set up an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. **SSH Access**: Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
3. **Data Transfer**: Transfer the COVID-19 dataset to the EC2 instance.
4. **Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis using Python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib.
5. **Results**: Visualize and interpret the analysis results.

## Usage

1. Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH: `ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@<ec2_instance_ip>`.
2. Transfer the dataset to the EC2 instance using `scp`.
3. Execute Python scripts to perform data analysis.
4. Visualize the results using matplotlib.
5. Save or export the analysis results as needed.
